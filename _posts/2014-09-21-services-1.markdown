  Development of segmentation and classification processes for automatic detection of cancerous cells.
  [Primaa](https://www.primaalab.com/) develops AI-based software for automated and accurate histological diagnoses. From the beginning, the company has been working in close partnership with pathologists and medical teams throughout the world to specify the needs and constantly adapt their solutions.

  I was part of the main project, implementing deep learning algorithms in image classification and increasing the performances. I worked a lot with image processing and clustering.
